# Snake

The aim of this project is to calculate the amount of possible paths of a given number of steps a snake can take inside a two dimensional grid. For that, the program expects the user to type the size of the grid, as well as the initial position of the snake. Then the user will introduce the number of movements that have to be checked and the program will print the solution to the specific scenario. 

- Considerations

  - To be able to run the tests, the library JUnit must be imported and added to the classpath; else, the project won't compile. Even when this is not done, the project can still be run executing the main class (App.java). This execution can be done both using the terminal or an IDE.

  - Once it has been executed and the number of paths are printed, the execution will end and to calculate another scenario, the program will have to be run again.
